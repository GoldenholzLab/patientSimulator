synthetic patient seizure diary simulator and RCT simulator

WHAT IS THIS REPOSITORY FOR?:

    This repository is meant

In order to generate one patient:

    The PatientClass.py script is responsible for generating one synthetic patient. In order to use this code 
    in a customized script, the PatientClass.py script must be imported as 'from PatientClass import Patient'.
    This will allow the customized script to instantiate a Patient object. The first four parameters inputted to
    the initialization of the Patient object are the group level parameters for the NV model. It is recommended to
    to use [PARAMETERS], which are the optimal parameters published in the [NAME] paper as according to NV model.

In order to generate one trial:

    The TrialArmClass script is responsible for generating one arm of a clinical trial consisiting of synthetic patients. 
    In order to use this code in a customized script, the TrialArmClass.py script must be imported as 'from TrialArmClass 
    import TrialArm'. This will allow the customized script to instantiate a TrialArm object. The first four parameters 
    inputted to the initialization of the Patient object are the group level parameters for the NV model. It is recommendedâˆ‚
    to use [PARAMETERS], which are the optimal parameters published in the [NAME] paper as according to NV model.

In order to generate the graphs associated with the [NAME HERE] paper:

    The testingTrialResults.py script is responsible for generating the graphs in the NAME HERE] paper. All that needs to be 
    done is to run it once, although it is not unusual for the script to take up to an hour in order to generate all the trials 
    of synthetic patients needed for the RCT analysis.


testingTrialResults.py

    This is the main script which generates the graphs in the paper associated with this repository. It has 
    dependencies on TrialArmClass.py, PatientClass.py, seizureMods.py, RR50Test.py, and MPCTest.py

TrialArmClass.py

    This script provides the code for generating clinical trials of synthetic patients according to NV model. 
    It has dependencies on the PatientClass.py and seizureMods.py scripts.

PatientClass.py

    This script provides the code for generating one individual synthetic patient according to NV model. It 
    has a dependency on seizureMods.py.

seizureMods.py

    This script provides utility functions for applying the drug effect to synthetic patients as well as
    making sure patients comply with the RCT parameters if they are generated within the context of a trial.

RR50Test.py

    This script provides functions which evaluate the RR50 (50% responder rate) as well as the p-value (statistical significance)
    associated with the RR50, as according to the Fisher Exact test.

MPCTest.py

    This script provides functions which evaluate the MPC (median percent change) as well as the p-value (statistical significance)
    associated with the MPC, as according to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.

param_expl.py

    This script provides the code for doing one randomly initialized search for optimal NV model parameters 
    over the parameter space of the group level effects for NV model. It puts the final result of its 
    search into a small text file.

param_expl_wrap.sh

    This is a shell wrapper script for submitting the param_expl.py script as batch job to the Harvard Medical School O2 computing cluster.

param_expl_wrap_coordinator.sh

    This is a shell script which submits many searches over the parameter space of the NV model to the Harvard Medical School O2 computing cluster.

output_searcher.py

    This script searches among the text files outputted by param_expl.py to find the most optimal set of parameters from amongst the set of 
    optimized parameters.
